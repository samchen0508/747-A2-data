The drawing for when it is right doesn't quite look ok. Have a read again of the notes in this question. It says:
- The turtle should draw up the page as the first step, by turning left by 90 degrees
- The turtle should turn left or right by 120 degrees for either the left arrow or right arrow

These two steps are the same for whether the turtle turns left or right.  See if that helps you get a bit closer to the solution.

The problem is with the 3rd line of your code, 

```py3
from turtle import *
arrow =int(input('Which way? '))
  if arrow = left
  forward (100)
  left (120)
```
See how your `if` statement is indented a few spaces in. This is causing python to get confused. The `if` statement should start with no space before it, just like the line above it. 

Then, everything that you want inside the `if` statement (such as the forward and left commands), should be indented inside it.

If you want a reminder, have a look at some of your solutions to the previous problems (such as Backetball Bunny), for an example of how to correctly indent an `if` statement.

You are almost there. Reread the dot points carefully. The second one says:

The turtle should draw up the page as the first step, by turning left by 90 degrees

So, no matter which way it is meant to go,  the first step always has to be turn left. You are doing this correctly when movin == ""left"" - but not when movin == ""right"".

See if you can figure this out now. It's one small fix from here.

Three things wrong. First you need to store the result of the ```input()```  in a variable:

```direction = input('Which way? ')```

Then you need to compare the ```direction``` with a string eg. ```""right""```, and finally you need to start new line after the colon (:) in the ```if``` and ```elif``` statements.

Remember that any lines that are indented after your `if` or `else` will be what is run according to the `if` statement. For example:
```
if name == 'left':
  # Do something that should happen if name is equal to 'left'.
  # Do something else.
else:
  # Do something that should happen if name is equal to 'right'.
  # Do something else.

For example, let's say I want to make a program that tells me whether I've inputted `'left'` or `'right'`. That would look something like:

```
direction = input('Left or right? ')
if direction == 'left':
  print('You chose left!')
else:
  print('You chose right!')
```

Notice how the `print('You chose left!')` only runs *if* we enter `'left'`. Anything inside that `if` block (that is, anything after the `if` condition that is indented) will also only be run if the condition we give it is `True`.

The tutors will always reply to you as soon as we can. So sending lots of extra messages won't make us get back to you any quicker. 

You shouldn't need to copy and paste two versions of your code like that. You should only import the turtle once, and you should only ask for input once.

After that, you'll need to use an `if` statement to decide if you should draw the left triangle or the right triangle. (You should never draw both at once)

Take another look at [this page](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/41208047/challenge-beginners-2018/w1p2/11/) of the notes. In there, it explains how `forward()` is used to move the turtle forwards, but `left()` and `right()` make the turtle turn on the spot.

Think of it like driving a car. You can't make it magically move to the left or right. Instead you need to first turn it so the car is facing the direction you want to move, and then press the accelerator to go forwards.

So, instead of starting with `right(30)`, because the turtle is already facing in the correct direction, you can start with `forward(30)`.

Just because you've written code, doesn't mean it will always output something.

If you read the question carefully, along with what the marker is telling you, you'll see that you need to ask the user for an angle before you draw anything. To do this, you'll need to use the `input()` function.

The NCSS Challenge questions are meant to be completed in order, because they teach you what you'll need to know to solve the later questions. I suggest you go back and try and finish the earlier questions from this week first. That will help you when it comes time to solve this one :)

Let's say you call `draw_fan(8)`. This will draw a fan with 8 blades, by calling `draw_blade` 8 times with the loop on line 21.

Let's figure out what those calls will look like. We calculate fade on line 22, which will be:
```
fade = 255/num_blades = 255/8 = 31.875

Then, we call `draw_blade` with this value.
```
draw_blade(fade) = draw_blade(31.875)

As Hui previously mentioned, you will need to iteratively increment the amount of fade as you draw the blades of the fan. Have a look at [this slide](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/40254804/challenge-beginners-2018/w5p1/1/) to see how you can modify a variable while looping. You will need to use the same idea here to increment the fade.

Hope this helps!

You're getting really close. Two things to remember, after you draw each blade, the turtle is going to be left facing 90 degrees to the `left`, i.e. not in the same direction as it started.

You're really close!

if you take a really close look at the example in the question, you will see that after you draw a single blade, the turtle is facing up.

correcting the turtle's facing to get the 20 degree shift between blades belongs in the draw_fan() function -- so if you move the commands that do that from the draw_blade() function to the draw_fan() function, you should be even closer",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

I'm not 100% sure how this happened, but it looks like your program has some 'strange' space characters in it that are confusing the grok system. Possibly because you copied the code in from a word processor or different program, or possibly you are using a tablet (iPad?) which uses slightly different characters for space.

I've flagged this to the grok staff to look at the system, but we can try to fix it here in the meantime.

Remember how in the last question, you had to make your own functions? That's what you'll have to do for this question.

That means you'll need all the bits like `def draw_blade(fade):` 

I recommend you start back with the original code we gave you, and try again from there:

```
from turtle import *

def draw_blade(fade):
  # Draw a faded blue fan blade.
  pass
  
def draw_fan(num_blades):
  # Call the draw_blade function to draw a fan.
  pass

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
  # Test a single fan blade:
  draw_blade(200)

  # Test a fan with 8 blades:
  #draw_fan(8)

I would suggest moving the `def draw_fan` function outside of the `if __name__ == ...`part. Then you can run the function by doing something like this under the `if __name__ ...` part:

Not to worry - we are all very happy to help you. As for your question, you are actually heading in the correct direction with the idea of changing the value of the fade inside the loop. Have a look at [this slide](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/40650060/challenge-beginners-2018/w5p1/1/) to see how you can modify a variable while looping. You will need to use the same idea here to increment the fade.

Hope this helps!

Getting closer, Two things to do.
 1. Looks like `draw_blade` is not working quite correctly. When I run it like `draw_blade(200)` I should get a faded blue fan blade, but instead it looks like I get a red blade. Similarly when I run `draw_blade(0)`, I should get a dark blue fan blade.
You can check that this works by changing line `33` and running your code.

 2. We need to fill in `draw_fan` to call the `draw_blade` function `num_blades` times. We can do this using a loop in the `draw_fan` function. If you read the question, you should see what needs to happen each time the loop is run.

Please be respectful and patient when sending messages to people online.

Since the NCSS Challenge is now over, we won't be providing any more tutoring support, and you can now read the solutions yourself. There are two things you needed to do to finish this question:

1. Add `end_fill()` to the end of the `draw_blade` function, like this:

```
def draw_blade(fade):
  # Draw a faded blue fan blade.
  red = fade
  green = fade
  blue = 255
  fillcolor(red, green, blue)
  begin_fill()
  forward(100)
  left(90)
  forward(20)
  goto(0, 0)
  right(90)
  end_fill()
```

2. Fix a typo on this line:

```
    draw_blade(1*255/num_blades)
```

I think you meant `i` instead of `1`. Multiplying by `i` means you'll draw with a different fade each step through the loop, because `i` will have a different value at each step through the loop.

Great work on finishing the NCSS Challenge; it looks like you did really well!",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

64863ca36fe27a14afa1a0f3d457e333,287227,1535840755,"Hi Tayla, certainly. :) 
Let's take a look at the error you are getting:
```
ValueError: red component of colour must be in the range [0, 255] (not 2040)
```

When we set colours, we need to remember that they are between 0 and 255. This error is saying that we tried to set one of the colours to 2040 which is outside the range.

If we take a look at your program, we can see that this is happening because of your draw_fan function:
```
def draw_fan(num_blades):
  # Call the draw_blade function to draw a fan 
  fade = 255*num_blades
  draw_blade(fade)
```

Notice how you're multiplying the `num_blades` by 255? This results in the fade being larger than 255 sometimes and is why we get this error.

Remember, the problem description says that the fade between each blade is calculated by *dividing*: `255 / num_blades`.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

but it comes out with that  the function is not iterable  for the the function in the for sentence.

I have tried and tried and have still not exceded.

could i please have some help as I have been wracking my brain off and am starting to go mad over why I cant figure it out.

Looks like you are drawing the blades correctly in this question, but they still need to be coloured in properly. This can be done by setting the `fillcolor()`.

The forward() doesn't return a value so it doesn't make sense to say width = forward(width) on line 5. You should just say forward(width) as you have done in the past. Same with forward(height) on line 7.

It looks like you haven't finished this function yet and you need to call forward() two more times to draw the other two sides of the rectangle. You will at least need to complete the call to forward() on line 9 before your code will work.

The function draw_rect doesn't need to return anything, so you don't need line 10. Even if it did need to return something, returning a reference to the function itself as you are currently doing wouldn't really be useful. I'd suggest just removing line 10.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

You'll get a recursion error if you use a function inside itself with no way for it to stop. In this case, you're trying to use `draw_rect` inside `draw_rect`!

When you run your code, it will run everything that isn't in your function which is why it looks correct! The marker is using your `draw_rect` function directly though. Try moving the code to draw *one* rectangle into `draw_rect`, and then add this to your code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
  draw_rect(110, 30, 'cornflowerblue')
  draw_rect(20, 120, 'forestgreen')

Once you fix up the `draw_rect` function to work for any width, height, and colour then you should get the same drawing.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

You are sooo close!

```
for number in range(number):

When you ask the user to enter 'How many?', you are storing this in the variable called `number`. In your loop, you are re-using `number` as the loop variable as well as the range. This is causing a syntax error as it starts off being zero.

Then, once that's done, you should find it easy to write code to give the turtle directions.

Finally, you'll need to make sure that before you start drawing with the turtle, that you change the pen colour to be the correct colour for the season, and that you set the line to be the correct thickness.

[These notes here](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/39748127/challenge-beginners-2018/w2p2/12/) show you how to change the colour.

Great work figuring out the tree shapes. 

One thing to watch when you use 'if' is how you let the computer know which lines of code to run if the condition is true, for example if question does equal Summer.

Have you heard if indenting? It's when you move your lines of code to the right by two spaces (or a tab) - this lets the computer know it's code only to run when the 'if' statement is true. 

So:

if question == ""Summer""
    from turtle import *
    pensize(10)

etc.

39af97da4fef52e9dd4ee44c877f8461,260191,1534562168,"Hi Paige! This is a *really* awesome attempt so far - your summer tree works almost perfectly! The thing I can see that might be confusing you right now is choosing what parts of your code you want to run *conditionally*. What you're doing right now is:
```
if season == 'summer':
 pencolor('green')
pensize(10)
forward(50)
# ...
```

What this does is it checks `if season == 'summer'`, and then runs `pencolor('green')` *only if* that's `True`. However, no matter what, your program will *always* run
```
pensize(10)
forward(50)
# ...
```
because of the way you've indented those lines. To specify what lines you want to be part of an `if` *block*, you'll need to indent (typically using two spaces) the lines that you want to only run `if` some condition is `True`. So you might instead want to do:

```
if season == 'summer':
  pencolor('green')
  pensize(10)
  forward(50)
  # ...
```

Also, try thinking about the order in which you want your program to do things. Maybe you'd want your trunk-drawing code to run at the end, because it's the last thing that happens.

I am working on the ?€?seasonal trees?€?.  I have written code for the ?€?summer?€? tree which was successful.

However when I add code for the ?€?autumn?€? tree, regardless of whether I input ?€?summer?€? or ?€?autumn?€?), my program draws the triangle / leaves in black, draws the square / trunk in brown, then traces over the black triangle in brown. 

I was expecting for the turtle to stop drawing once it completes the ?€?summer?€? tree, and to draw the ?€?autumn?€? tree in the colour orangered (as per the guidelines)

I am unsure how to get my turtle to only draw a single tree, the elif and if clauses haven?€?t worked so far.

Remember that in Python, the `if` block (the bit of code to be run `if` the condition is `True`) is indented so that it's to the right of the `if` (usually two spaces). For example,
```
if season == 'Autumn':
  pencolor('orangered')
  pensize(10)
  # ...
```
would be valid.

In your case, you're doing:
```
if season == 'Autumn': 
pencolor('orangered')

The co-ordinates are passed in to the `draw_swatch` function. 

You're already doing that. When you call the line:
```
draw_swatch(20, 10, 'violet')
```
That sends the information 20, 10 and the string `'violet'` to the `draw_swatch` _function_.

So in your code. The following two lines
```
def draw_swatch(x, y, colour):
  goto(x, y)
  # do some other stuff
```
will make the turtle goto 20, 10. Because that's the information you're passing in.

You are every close now to solving the question. If you look at the output from the test, notice that the left hand side of the square is not drawn properly. This is because your turtle did not turn left by the full 90 degrees. To fix this, you will need to change the turning angle of the turtle so that it turns the full 90 degrees.

Hope this helps!

962139825eda0c537a1dfd8ca26e9f83,254575,1534211431,"Hi Kieren,

In a `for` loop, we need a sequence of things to loop over. For example, we can [loop over a string](https://groklearning.com/learn/challenge-beginners-2018/w3p2/1/) because a string is just a sequence of characters (like letters, numerals, punctuation, or emoji). So a `for` loop on a string just says ""do this for each character in the string"".

If we want to repeat something a specific number of times (say, 5 times), then we need a sequence which has 5 things in it. We could do this using strings, if we had a word of the right length:

```python
for i in 'apple':
  print('This sentence is repeated 5 times.')
```

But we shouldn't need to have a word of the right length just because we want to do something 5 times. The `range` function gives us sequence with the right number of things in it. If we wanted to do something 5 times, we can put it in a `range(5)` loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
  print('This sentence is repeated 5 times.')
```

And because the number that `range` takes can be a variable, we can ask the user how many times to loop (like you've done with `a` in this question).

That's the really simple answer: doing a `for` loop on `range(x)` will repeat the same thing `x` times.

Where `range` is also useful is that the sequence it uses will give you each number from 0 up to one less than your input number. So we can use this to count things, not just repeat the same thing over and over:

```python
for i in range(5):
  print('The next number is', i)
```

The variable `i` is used to hold the current value we're up to in the sequence. It doesn't have to be called `i`, we can rename it like this:

```python
for a in range(5):
  print('The next number is', a)
```

The slides [from here](https://groklearning.com/learn/challenge-beginners-2018/w3p2/4/) show you how to use range for counting from a different starting point, or counting backwards, and so on.

In short, we can use `range` to either:

* repeat the same thing a specific number of times (like we did in this question), or
* count between two numbers (like we did in the Lift Off question)",FALSE,TRUE,MESSAGE

Here's a hint: To set the pencolor of the turtle, you need to call the `pencolor` function like this:

`pencolor(""blue"")`

Or perhaps: `pencolor(""red"")`

`pencolor(""green"")`

And to set the pensize, you need to call the `pensize` function like this: 

`pensize(5)`

The way you can think about it is that the turtle begins with a default colour and thickness, and will use that for drawing all the lines until you tell it otherwise. For example, you could draw lines in red, and then change it to blue:

```py3
from turtle import *

forward(100)
left(120)

pencolor('red')
pensize(2)

forward(100)
left(120)

pencolor('blue')

You are very nearly there. Your drawing code inside the loop is exactly right.
The problem is in setting up the loop.

You ask the user for the number of steps and then put that number in the `steps` variable - so far, so good.
But have a closer look at what your `for` loop is doing. Right now, you are telling it to loop from 1 up to `steps` decreasing the count by 1 each time.

Every bracket ( needs to have a corresponding close bracket ). Check your first line again to ensure that the brackets are closed properly. The input has a set of brackets (""..."") and because you have an int around that, the whole set needs to be enclosed in brackets. Another way to check is the number of (( and )) you have in a line of code - they need to be equal.

Next, try to draw one step. Once you get that working, the next part becomes a little clearer. You don't know how many steps you will draw (but you do know that it's the same set of instructions to draw a step that will be repeated). Can you think of anything you have learnt so far that will help you repeat a set of steps?

You're so close on this one! There's just one line that is in the wrong spot which is causing the marker to see tiny little differences. It's not really something you can spot easily, so I'm going to tell you which line it is.

The problem is where you have this line:
```
  bgcolor('#444444')
```
You have it in the `draw_line` function, which means that every time you draw a line, it resets the background.

What's a better place to put that background? We really only want the background to be drawn once, so you could put it under this line:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

Or under the line:
```
def draw_elevator():
```

That way, the background will only get drawn once.

9acfe31ee6c662d8652b1c1bd9bf00a4,279638,1535524763,"Hi Joseph,

You have written the `draw_line` function but you never call it. You are drawing the 6 lines manually in the `main` section.

The idea behind using a function like `draw_line` is that it allows you to repeat tasks more easily and it means that if you have a problem in your drawing code, you only have to fix it in one place instead of in 6 places.

In your `draw_line` function, you are using the `height` correctly.
But the `redness` is not being applied. In the instructions, it says that the `redness` value should be used to set the red channel of the RGB colour, with the blue and green channels both set to zero.

You are using hex values to set `pencolor`, so you might like to review [RGB with Turtle](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/40424615/challenge-beginners-2018/w5p2/7/) to reminder yourself how to set the `pencolor` using RGB values.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

dd923a5a4663915cad2f9a7f390622a3,283205,1535690172,"Hi Lincoln,

If you look at the at the result of the marking, notice that you get an error when testing a black line with y-coordinate of 0 (i.e. when running `draw_line(0,0)`).  When I modified your code to call `draw_line(0,0)`, this is the error that I get:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""program.py"", line 33, in <module>
    draw_line(0,0)
  File ""program.py"", line 7, in draw_line

  File ""/opt/grok/python3/turtle.py"", line 1595, in check_color
    raise TypeError('Expected an RGB triple or string color name')
TypeError: Expected an RGB triple or string color name
```

If you look at the error message, notice that the `TypeError` is caused by the call of `pencolor` inside the `draw_line` function and the reason for this is because the value of `R` is not in the correct type (i.e. format). Don't forget that the `redness` argument of the `draw_line` function is the value for the red channel of the pen.

Hope this helps!

Your code is looking interesting but you aren't using your function. A function is something that you build once but use over and over again, given different arguments.

For this question, you only need one function, which is the `draw_line` function. What Ben was trying to explain to you before is that you can create the 6 lines for the elevator using a `for` loop by calling the `draw_line`  function inside the `for` loop.

Here is an example of how you can use a `for` loop to call a function multiple times:

```py3
def times(number):
  return number*2

for i in range(10):
  print(times(i))
```

c410bdea8abd6f344d9d06e96679f4db,285268,1535775722,"Hi Emily,

As Craig previously mentioned, the reason that your code failed is because you are drawing too many lines when the `draw_line` function is called. If you have a closer read at the question (part 1), notice that that `draw_line` function is meant to draw 1 line only with the given `redness` and `height`. However, in your code, the `draw_line` function actually draws the entire elevator, not a single line. You will need to first fix your `draw_line` function so that it only draws 1 line. Then, you can use the `draw_line` function to draw the 6 lines for the elevator.

Hope this helps!

You're code is failing to run because there is nothing in the `if` statement. Perhaps add a call to draw line inside the if statement on line 23?

The `pass` function is just a word that means do nothing. Python will just skip over that line, and it will have no effect. It's used as a placeholder, for example if we want to make an empty function that will need to get filled in, we can put in a `pass` statement, so the rest of the code works.

The reason why your code is not setting the background colour properly is because you are not calling the `bgcolor` function properly.

Remember that to use the `bgcolor`, you need to do it like this:

```
bgcolor(""forestgreen"")
```

or, you can also pass in the hex value, like this:

```
bgcolor('#111111')
```

Hope this helps!

The reason why your code is failing the test is actually not because of the line (your code actually produced the correct line!), but rather because the background colour gets changed when calling the draw_line function. If you look at the question again, notice that for part 1 (finishing the draw_line function), all you need to do is to draw a line (without changing the background). You only need to change the background when creating the elevator itself.

Hope this helps!

For your height you are currently staying in the same place, notice how you are calling for `h` (`height`) in the line below but never changing the value of `h`? This is causing your line to draw in the same place over and over again.

```goto(-50, h)```

For your redness you need to consider the order of operations that Python is going to perform for you. The last thing you do is:

```x += 40```

and then the program loops back around. One of the first things you then do is set `x = 0`, wiping away your previous change. When you are doing something like this you need to declare the variable outside of the loop so that it isn't reset every time the loop runs.

For example if we arranged it like this we would have `x = 0` when the function is first called and then each loop would increase it by the set amount.

```
def draw_line(redness, height):
  x = 0
  for i in range(6):

The reason why you are getting the `NameError` is because the marker is testing the `draw_line` function specifically. If you try adding the following like `draw_line(0,0)` inside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block and run your code, you will see the same `NameError`.

The reason for this error is because you have not yet created the variable `red`, `blue` or `green` and are trying to use it inside the `pencolor` function. Don't forget also that you need to have each of the command in line 5 and 6 in separate lines, not in a single line.

I think your problem may have to do with the number of shapes you're drawing and the number of sides they have. Notice that the turtle is drawing only partial octagons - it only draws five sides before turning to start the second octagon.
You need to put some thought into how many times things need to be drawn for each shape, and I think you'll need another for loop too.

You might also want to check your current solution for the triangles, I suspect it's actually drawing more than it needs to! This might help you discover what's wrong with the octagons.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

I have a problem with this topic. 

1. For the first one I'm able to obtain the shape of the three polygons but the turtle faces the wrong way. 

2.  When the 2nd example, I'm able to obtain the shape however, it repeats the shape to many times

3.  The 3rd example, I'm not able to achieve the shape at all 

I'm confused if the code is meant to produce all these examples or not 

here's my present code:

# Calculate the angle between sides
angle = 360 / num_sides

#------------------------------------------------------#
# Start drawing a polygon below.                       #
# Use num_sides and angle which we calculated for you. #
#------------------------------------------------------#
for i in range(3):
  pencolor('gold')
  pensize(8)
  forward(30)
  left(angle)
  forward(30)
  left(angle)
  forward(30)
  left(angle)
  forward(30)
  left(angle)
  forward(30)
  left(angle)
  forward(30)
  left(angle)
  right(120)

Looks like you're getting closer. The trick to this problem is having two loops. The inner one needs to draw `num_sides` sides of the polygon, and an outer one that does this three times.

When I run your code, I get an `IndentationError` - that means that the indenting (the spaces at the beginning of the line) aren't quite right, and the computer doesn't understand what it's meant to do.

Remember that all `for` loops need to have the thing that you want it to do _indented_ in. 

I think in this case though, that you probably want line 10 (`  for s in range(sides):`) and line 14 (`  for s in range(sides):`) un-indented, so you remove the spaces so it's right at the beginning of the line. Otherwise it would happen too many times.

Quick hint for sending us code, if you save your program, we can see it, so you don't have to copy and paste your whole code into the window :)

You're really close with this one. Two things to keep in mind. When drawing the shape, always turn **left** by `angle` degrees, then between each shape, always turn **right** by 120 degrees.

Is this what your program is doing each time?

Good luck :)",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

I suggest you reset to the starting program. Click on the arrow beside ""program.py"" at the top of your code and click 'Reset'.

The starting program shows how to ask for the number of sides and then calculates the angle that your turtle needs to turn between the sides of the polygons.

Now have another read of the part of the instructions that gives the details for each polygon. These are the steps that need to be inside your loop.

The guidance Rachel has given already is spot on.
(1) it looks like your ```if``` statement isn't part of the loop body
(2) to fix it you will need to indent the lines correctly. (all of the lines that make up the ```if``` statement)
(3) Rachel has given you some links to slides which will help you understand the indentation.

You are correct that your program will need a `for` loop, but you seem to have mixed it up a bit with checking for run/jump.

I suggest you start by having the program print out one letter at a time from `x`, with each letter on a separate line. This will involve a `for` loop. Do you think you know how to do that?

Once you have that working, you can then modify the program to print Run or Jump instead of each letter.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

```
x = 7
if x < 7:

Notice how you create a variable called `x`, and make it equal to 7. The next line you ask, *""Is x less than 7?""*. But you just set it so that x is always equal to 7. So that `if` statement will always be false, and you'll always print `'No record yet. Keep training!'`.

When you compare numerical values (like you are trying to do in line 2), both values have to be numbers. Putting quotation marks around the 7 treats that value like a string, and not a number. Therefore, the comparison doesn't actually work.

See the previous slide Making decisions with numbers. Anytime you put "" "" around text, Python thinks it is a string and not a number. Hope this helps. Let me know how you go.

At the moment, your `for` loop is going through these steps for each character in the string:

1. Check if the character is a letter (`if c.isalpha()`)
2. If it is, shift it to the next letter, and store the new letter in the `character` variable
3. Add this new `character` to the output string

The `character` variable only gets updated when `c` is a letter. If you test your code with `""aa bb""` as input, you'll get `bbbcc` as output.

Because the space isn't a part of the alphabet, your program skips the `if` code and adds whatever is in the `character` variable to the output string.

I see you're also working on [*Hidden in Plain Sight*](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/40156792/challenge-intermediate-2018/w3p2/19/#open-tutor-chat-thread) - I suggest you finish that one first - switching between questions gets confusing very quickly.

I'll give you one hint for now, then once you finish the other question, you can come back to this question and we'll give you some more help (you can still ask for help on the other question).

The reason you got
```py3
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'upper'
```
is because you probably tried `j.upper()` which would make `j` (the number) uppercase - you can't change the case of a number! You probably meant to do `code.upper()` or similar.

As for the trailing newline, when you do `print` without setting `end=''`, it will put a newline at the end. I think you might have been looking at [these Intermediate notes](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/40156792/challenge-intermediate-2018/w2p2/10/) - they might help you out with a couple of ways to make the output.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

This is because the first time your `for` loop runs, you're actually overwriting the `message` string, and turning it into `ord(message[i])`, which is an integer. Then, the next time the loop runs, it tries to run `message = ord(message[i])`, but it can't do `message[i]` because `message` is an integer, not a string!

Can you think of a way to fix this so that you don't lose `message`, the original string?

P.S. We want to print each `next_character`, but all in the same line. If you try to `print(next_character)` inside the `for` loop, you'll notice that it prints them all on a new line, which isn't what we want.

The question asks you to change only letters that are upper case. So you'll need to check if the letter is upper case before changing it.

Be careful though, because you'll have to deal with spaces too..

A few tips:

- Letters should be converted with `+1`, which the program is doing correctly

For any characters that are not in the alphabet, your program will need to print the **same** character. For example, a space should be a space, a question mark should be a question mark. So, you will need an `if` statement to determine whether or not to change the character.

To make them print on one line, you have a couple of choices:

You could store the characters in a variable and then just print the variable at the end, like this:

```py3
output += next_character
```

And at the end, just print `next_character`.

The print function will print each string on a new line. Since you are trying to print everything on the same line, I'd suggest appending all the characters you are trying to print onto a coded_msg and then printing the coded_msg once at the end.

Also, you are using the variable ""code"" to mean different things at different times. This might get confusing. I'd suggest using different names for different things. For example on line one you do code = input('Secret message: '). What you've got there is a whole message that hasn't been coded yet. Why don't you call that something like ""message"" instead of code.

As you have mentioned in your message, the `ord` function expects a single character as an input, rather than the entire string. As such, you will actually need to run the `ord` function for each character in the string, rather than on the entire string.

Python has very strict rules for writing `for` loops and `if` statements.

Each line that starts with `for` , `if`, `else` and other similar keywords must end with a colon :

And the lines after that that are inside the loop or inside the if, they must be indented. In this case, you have an `if` inside a `for` so the lines that are inside the `if` need to be indented twice.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

When we use `for letter in line` like you have, the `letter` variable becomes each individual letter in the string `line`. This means when we want to modify the letter, we should call that variable (letter), not the whole string (line). 

You'll also need to look at the `ord()` function. simply saying `letter + 1` won't really do anything because `letter` is a string of 1 character, so adding strings and integers won't work. `ord() will help you find out what number in the alphabet your character is, then you can modify it with addition.

You have made a great start, there are a couple of things to remember here. The first is that your variable names are a bit confusing, variable names should tell you what you are working on, for example your variable 'a' could be called 'originalmessage' so you know that you are working on the original message. That way, when you need to print the secret message later you can call it 'secretmessage'

The next thing to notice is that your program is currently going over every single character, not just the upper case letters. Can you see the exclamation marks (!) in your output? They are what happens when your program adds 1 to the unicode of a space.  You should check that you are only working on upper case letters.

The last thing to look at is your program printing every letter on a new line. Your program needs to add each letter to a new message, then print the whole message in one line. You can start a new string by naming the variable as an empty string, like this

```secretmessage = ''```

Then add to it with something like 

```secretmessage = secretmessage + chr(secretletter)```

To solve this question, you can't have a `print` statement inside your `for` loop. Instead, you'll need to use another string variable to build up the final answer one character at a time. 

Then, once the `for` loop is finished, you can print out the final answer string.

```py3
my_word = ""hello""
for letter in my_word:
  print(letter)

Let's take a look at your program. Python uses *indentation* (spacing) to work out what's part of a loop (or conditional [`if`] statement), and what's not.

If you look closely, you'll see that your `else` isn't indented, so it's not part of the loop - this means that the `else` will only run once at the end of the `for` loop.

Since spaces will be `False` for the `if character.isupper():`, it would check for an `else`, but the `else` isn't part of the loop, so it just goes to the next character.

Looking good so far!

As per the instructions: ""Note: punctuation and whitespace are not shifted. Only letters!""

Therefore, your program will need to use an `if` statement to only shift letters, not punctuation. The `if` statement will go _inside_ the `for` loop.

Since the letters will always be UPPERCASE, you can use this to identify the letters:

if character.isupper():

Good work so far - you are nearly there.

To get the spaces and other characters to print, you need to indent the `else` so that it is lined up with the `if` and not with the `for`.

And to get the characters printing on the same line, I suggest that instead of printing each character as you process it, you create a new variable and append each processed character to this variable.

Different approaches you could take:
1. Test whether each character is something you _don't_ want to encrypt. Encrypt everything else
2. Test each character and **only encrypt** the ones that are uppercase letters. Leave other characters the same

As per the instructions:

I can see that you've already worked out the very first step, which is to ask the user how many Pokemon they've caught. Nice work!

The question wants you to work out how many Pokemon are left to collect, and I see this as three steps.

1. Find out how many Pokemon are left to collect (by doing some cool subtraction maths)
2. Print out the message, ""You still need to get...""

The tricky parts of this problem are the numbers and words. Your first line is excellent, so don't change that!

You've used `int` in your first line, which tells the computer straight away that **a** is a number. The computer will remember this, so you don't need to use `int` anywhere else in your program when talking about **a**.

When you type stuff inside apostrophes (like `'hello'`, or `'100'`) the computer will treat everything inside them as words (or *strings*).

This means that if you have a number in green, like `'100'`, the computer won't know that it's supposed to be a number, so it won't be able to do maths on it.

Can you see if there are any numbers in your code which the computer might be treating as words?",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

At the moment you have 2 inputs, a and b. For this question you'll only need one, which is the number of pokemon the user has caught.

It looks like you've made a  bit of a start.

The first thing you'll do is need to ask the user `'How many have you caught? '`, and store it as a number (using `int`). 

Once that's done, you need to calculate and print out how many pokemon that the user still needs to get.

See in the example in the question on the left, the blue writing is what the computer is printing and the black is what you type in when you press run. The second line doesn't have any black writing which means you don't need any input. 

So, on line 2 you only need to write `print` instead of `input` so you can make the computer say `""You still need to get...""` and on the next line you just need to print the answer. (which is 151 minus whatever you wrote on line one when you pressed run).

7213a76569829ca8a3a1f80eb778a8dc,247545,1533614370,"Hi Zoe,

Although us humans see 123 and 123 as the same thing, computers are not as clever and need much more detail. ""123"" is treated as a string (almost like a series of alphabet letters) and 123  (without the quotation marks) is treated as a number. 

So, although you have the right logic in line 1, the input has to be treated as a number (integer), because we want to do arithmetic calculations with it.

To get an input as a number, you need to do something like this:
a = int(input('Enter a number: '))

Also, in line 2, you dont need to ask for input. Re-read the question, you only need to print(""You still need to get..."").",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

Take a close look at the question:  when given the input `Dance`, we want to print `Dance Dance Revolution`. If you look closely at that string, it has a few components: The word the user typed (`word`), a space (`' '`), the word the user typed again (`word`), another space (`' '`) and finally the word revolution (with a capital R).

Now we just need to concatenate (a fancy word that means add together) these pieces into the final result. Does that make sense? :)

Just wanted to say, great job on the Challenge so far! You're so far along, nice work :D

I just noticed your submission for Dance Dance Revolution. You're *soo* close to the answer! If you read the question carefully, it's asking for the first word to be repeated twice. So, if the user enters 'Dab', it should say 'Dab Dab', and if they enter 'Dance', it should say 'Dance Dance'.

Did you know, you can re-use variables more than once in a `print()` statement? For example, you can run the following, and it will print the word 3 times:

```
Word = input('Word? ')
print(Word + Word + Word)
```

Give it a try! I hope this helps :)

Keep up the great work! :)

You have the first line right, where you are asking for the Word and storing it in a variable.  So if the user types in Dance or Nap or Eat or Sleep, it will be stored in that variable. Well done!

Now, instead of printing out ""Dance Dance Revolution"" every time, you need to print out the variable. Remember that your variable contains that value: a variable is a bit like an envelope, which contains the message or value. Because you don't know what the user might have typed, you used the variable - so now, try to print it out. That should take you closer to the solution. If you can't remember how to print out a variable, look at the previous two slides for examples.

Nice job on persevering, by the way. So much of programming is about trying different things and understanding not just what the code does, but how it works. Let me know if you need help or any more hints.

Dance Dance Revolution is a popular arcade game.

It uses repetition to make the title catchy. Consider how boring Dance Revolution would be as a title.

Lets write a program to automate repeating the first word to create different game ideas:


Word? Dance
Dance Dance Revolution
?€?
It could be a specific dance move:


Word? Dab
Dab Dab Revolution
?€?
Or a game you might play if you're tired:


Word? Nap

The problem you have here is that because you use `elif`, you only ever get the count of one of the letters. As soon as one of your `if` or `elif` statements triggers, none of the others will.

However, for this question, you don't actually heed to use `if` or `elif` at all. This is because `count()` will work even if the letter isn't in the line.

You should just be able to do this:

```
line_1 = line.count('i')
line_4 = line.count('t')
line_3 = line.count('T')

Unfortunately, you can't use `.count()` to count more than one string.
`q.count('i')` will work find, but you'll get an error when you try `q.count('t', 'T')`.

Instead you can use a variable to store the value of the count of 't' and the count of 'T'. Remember, the values are just numbers so you can add them :)",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

count_t = msg.count('t')

Your solution is quite close, take a close look at the error. Notice it is telling you that you can't print numbers combined with strings?

The thing to remember with integers and strings is that you can only add strings to strings, but not integers to strings.

If you have something that is already a string, like `""I's dotted""`, then there's no need to pass that to the `str()` function, as you don't need to convert it into a string.

If you have a number, like `3`, or a function that returns a number, like `.count()`,  then you should turn it into a string like `str(3)` or `str(message.count('a'))` before adding it to another string.

It looks to me like your program is accepting what you type, but then it is giving the wrong result.

What you are actually asking in line 2 is how many times the string ""i's' dotted."" appears in the entered string.

To do that you'll have to make sure ```names``` and ```namess``` are saved as numbers (what the ```.count()``` returns) and not converted into strings (like you're doing in this line: ```names = str(msg.count('t'))```).

When you add two strings together, it joins them up, so `""hello"" + ""world""` becomes `""helloworld""`.

This is the same with any strings, even the ones which we know have numbers in them. The computer still sees strings as words, so `""1"" + ""1""` would be `""11""`, and `""1"" + ""2"" + ""3""` would be `""123""`.

So! You're really, really close. Think carefully about which things you want to add together as numbers, and which things you want to join together as strings.

**Hint** - you're totally allowed to have multiple things inside `str()` brackets. The computer does all the calculations inside the brackets first, and then turns the **result** into a string.

e.g. ```str(1 + 1)``` would give us `""2""` as a string.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

You must think about the difference between numbers and strings.

The ` + ` operator can be used on both. On numbers is adds the two number together. With strings is places one string after the other.

```py3
print (3 + 5)
print ('a' + 'b')
```

The `str()` function turns a number into a string. So:

```py3
print (str(5) + str(6))
```

prints ` 56 `.

As you know, `msg.count('t')` only counts the lowercase `t`s. I can think of 2 ways to get a total count:

Unfortunately, you can't use `or` to tell python to count multiple letters. 

To do this, you'll either need two separate counts, one for each type of T, and then add the results together.

Alternatively, you could convert the message all the lower case. Then you only need to count the lower case ts.

The program is getting confused between numbers (`int`) and words (`str`).

You can use this to convert a string into an integer number:

I just wanted to revisit your code here.

So I think that the condition in your `if` statement doesn't actually do what you intended it to do. It is actually read by Python like this:

```
if ('Paul Jennings') and ('Garth Nix' in name):
```

The reason your code passed the test cases, however, is probably because of a misunderstanding of the question.

Your indentation is a bit off. The lines of code that you want to run if your if statement is true are meant to be indented (to show they belong as a part of that if) but the if statement itself shouldn't be indented. Here's an example:

```python
raining = ""yes""
if raining == ""yes"":
  print(""Better bring an umbrella"")
else:
  print(""What a lovely day"")

which tells the computer that we've got some numbers, which we're calling `base` and `height`. We're not sure exactly what those numbers are, but we know that to calculate the area of **any** triangle, we need the base and the height, so we can just use those words instead of actual numbers.

You can work out the area of a triangle if you know the length across the bottom (the base) and the height. Once you've got these measurements, you can multiply `1/2 x base x height`, and you get the area!

6ea48876bca3d9f0b5ba1323eb9d9d3c,288393,1535865042,"Writing a function actually takes away the need for `input()`. You can **call** the function (explained [here](https://groklearning.com/learn/challenge-beginners-2018/w5p1/5/)) with different values.

For the rectangle example, we could write something like this:
```py3
def rectangle_area(length, height):
    return length * height
```
Working out the area of a rectangle uses the same formula every time, so we don't need to care about what the actual length and height numbers are.

We do **use** the length and height in the calculation though, so we stick them in the brackets after `def rectangle_area`. The `return` code there tells the computer what the answer is.

Once we've written the function, we can use it like this:
```py3
answer = rectangle_area(10, 5)
print(answer)
```
This is **calling** the function. You can see why we don't need to use `input()` here - instead, we fill in the length and height numbers inside those brackets.

So this would print out `50`, because it knows to multiply those two numbers in the brackets together!

Because we've got this formula, we can use it for **any** triangle (if we know the base and height).

In Python, functions are like formulas. For example, when calculating the area of a rectangle, we know that we need the side lengths. If someone asked, ""How do I work out the area of a rectangle?"" you could answer with ""Length times height."" That would work for any rectangle, no matter what its length or height was!

You are correctly asking for the 2 headlines and storing them in variables. That's great!

Now you need to use the `print_headline` function to print them out in the expected format.

It looks like you have duplicated the code inside the `print_headline` function but you don't need to do that. You do need to call it twice, once with the `text` variable and once with the `b` variable.

It looks like you have defined two identical functions called `print_headline()`. The idea of a function is to define a series of steps in code once so that it can be reused many times with different inputs, which are the parameters into the function. To use the function, you invoke it as Sheree hinted, with different arguments into the parameters. I would suggest you start by removing one copy of `print_headline()`. Let me know if you are still stuck.

This problem is a bit different to others as it's learning about calling functions.  You don't have to write another function just add some code to call the print_headline function to print the input headlines.  

So, I'd recommend you change the print_headline function back to how it was when you started the problem (you only need to change the second print line so it says  ```print(text)```. This is how it should look. 

```def print_headline(text):
  # Prints a headline with formatting
  dashes = '-' * len(text)
  print(dashes)
  print(text)
  print(dashes)

This line:

```
def count_vowels(message):
```

means that the function is called `count_vowels` and it will receive input from a variable called `message`. So, whatever message the user wants counted will be provided in the `message` variable.

The error you are receiving is because this line:

```
your_answer=count_vowels.count( 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
```

is telling Python to count the letters in `count_vowels`, which is _not_ a string.

Can you figure out how to change that line to count the right thing?

Also, please note that the `.count()` command can only count _one thing at a time_. So, you might want to start by having it count the number of lowercase A's.

Once you have that working, try to figure out how to count all the vowels. Each vowel will need a separate `.count()` command.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

``message`` is an argument in your function, which can be substituted by any value of the correct data type. So in this way, it doesn't really need to be further defined.

The objective of this program is to give you experience in writing a **function**.

Your job it to put code at the top where it says `# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE`. The incoming string is provided in the `message` variable. The code must count the number of vowels and then `return` that value to end the function.

The code at the bottom in the `if __name__` section is for testing. It will **call** the function to test that it is working correctly.

There is no need to `print` anything within the function itself.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

Remember, the code is read in a logical and sequential order. Anything that is indented (aligned) inside the if statement becomes part of that if.

You have started at CD (which is what gets typed in), and you want to go down to 0 - good! The last part tells the loop whether it should count up each time or count down each time, and by how much. 

For this problem, we are counting down from 10. The next number in the countdown would be 9, then 8, 7 and so on. If we want to up by 1 each time, the last part of the range should have 1. Can you think of how we write the number if we want to go the other way?

f638b200526175dfc997c8b97cf82e7d,265422,1534846187,"Hi Harriet!
Here is the code from the ""Looping backwards"" slide.
```py3
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
  print(i)	
```
There are three things you should notice about this code. Firstly, it has three numbers inside the range brackets, whereas your code currently only has two numbers. The first number inside the range brackets should indicate the number you want to start from. The second number should indicate the number you need to stop at. For example, you don't want to print 0, so you need to stop at zero. The last number will be -1, since you need go backwards by one number each time the program goes through the loop. 

You should also notice how the ""print(i)"" line in the example has been indented (or spaced further to the right). This is because the ""print(i)"" line is being executed ""inside"" the loop. 

Finally, your code does not have a colon after the ""for statement"". Notice how the example has a colon at the end of  ""for i in range(5, 0, -1): "". This is a part of the Python syntax that needs to be in every loop.

If you fix these three simple things, you should be able to pass this problem.

Remember, the way `range(start, stop, step)` works is that it goes through the numbers from `start` to `stop` (*including* `start`, but *excluding* `stop`), while stepping through the numbers `step` at a time.

In your case, you're trying to do `range(0, number, -1)`, which is starting at `0`, and trying to reach `number` by stepping `-1` at a time, which probably won't work since `number` is greater than `0`.

That's really close!

To make `range` work, we need to give it a couple of things, a starting number, a ending number, and a step. It should look like this: 

`range(start, stop, step)`

For example: 
- `range(4, 0, -1)` gives the numbers `4, 3, 2, 1`,

You are doing well so far and are close. I like the way you have tested it so far and narrowed down the problem.

Take another look at your input: what might the user enter? Numbers, right? So your input needs to be capable of handling the input as an int, and not as a string (hint hint!)

Next - the 3 values in the for .. in statement on line two looks pretty good, at least in terms of the syntax. The first value in the bracket is always what it starts with, the next value is what it goes up to, and the last one is how it steps through. Because you have the first value as a 10, it will ALWAYS start counting at a 10, even if the user in the first line has entered a 4.

We use `elif` for when we want an `if` statement to only be checked if the previous one failed. 

Seeing as we only ever want to print out one message for this question, I would say that all of your `if` statements, except the first one, should instead be `elif` statements.

Have a look at [this page of the notes](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/39748127/challenge-beginners-2018/w2p1/15/) for a good example of how to do it.

`else` goes at the end of your `if`s and `elif`s. Unlike `if` and `elif`, you don't need to type in something to check after it. You can just write something like:

Let's say the person types in `""cloudy""`! The computer reads every line in order. It's not sunny, and it's not rainy, so it continues and checks if it's cloudy. Because the person typed in `""cloudy""`, the program prints out `""It's cloudy!""`

But there are **HEAPS** of other things someone could type in. It could be windy, or stormy.

Because ""windy"" and ""stormy"" don't match with sunny, or rainy, or cloudy, the computer reads the last line. If the person typed in **anything else** other than those first three words, it will print `""I've never heard of that weather!""`

b4a60899e95a7e68dbb284f47b31a06f,255984,1534294047,"Hi Chloe. It looks like you have quite a tricky problem there.  Unfortunately, computers have multiple ways of representing a space character. It looks like in your `'MAYDAY??MAYDAY!'` message, you've used a different type of space than the normal one you get when you hit the space bar, and the marker is getting confused. This is extra tricky, because it's basically impossible to see the difference with your eyes alone.

Sometimes this can happens if you copy and paste text from somewhere else, such as a different program on your computer. In the future, it's best if you write your code in the Grok website (you can use the save button to make sure you don't lose anything). This will make sure this doesn't happen again.

Luckily it's easy to fix. Just hit backspace on the space between the two MAYDAYs, and hit the space bar again.

I am another female tutor and probably older than most of the other tutors. I came to programming a bit later than most but once I got into it, I realised it was what I most enjoyed. And I am in Queensland too, on the Gold Coast.

I am a tutor mainly because of my son Jack who went through NCSS summer school a couple of times and now works for Grok. He keeps pushing me to expand my capabilities so I have given a couple of masterclasses at the summer school and am now tutoring.

Programming is definitely challenging, but that is what makes it so exciting and rewarding. There are days when you feel like throwing your computer out the window because you can't work something out, but then there are the days when you do something that feels like magic and you can't stop smiling.

Good luck with the rest of the challenge, you are learning lots and there are some great people here and in the GPN to help you.

Sarah",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE
11eba822b716d31772f238baa219ed6a,259610,1534483239,"Hi Reece,

I volunteered to be a tutor because (a) I really like doing the challenge myself and (b) I enjoy working with students and love seeing their reaction when they work on a problem and solve it. I am a high school teacher now and used to be a professional software developer some years ago. It was fantastic and great fun to work on a problem and create a really unique solution to it - and my work took me all around the world too. It was hard at times, but also the right level of challenge because it always meant I was learning.  Right now, I am learning a language called Swift and teaching my students (all girls, by the way!) how to make apps for the Apple environment. Some other students are learning Javascript, and we have another bunch of students solving problems in Python!  Coding teaches you how to be persistent, think about problems in different ways and you get to create something that wasn?€?t there before.

This may sound strange, but I often say to my students that if they find something hard, it?€?s a sign that their brain is reacting to the challenge and actively making new connections. So, congratulations on finding it hard - it shows that you are really applying yourself! It?€?s also what makes programming so satisfying - once you figure it out, the sense of achievement and euphoria is just fabulous! You making it to GPN is a great start - you seem keen to learn, so keep practicing, ask for help and see if you can go along to more of the GPN meets. Good luck with the rest of the challenge. :)

I personally find coding really hard, and I need to do a **lot** of practise for code to seem easy to me. But my favourite part is knowing that I'm getting better at programming every single time I write a line of code.

You're becoming an amazing programmer, too! Think back to the first question of the Challenge. You might have found it super hard when you did it, especially if you'd never seen `print()` before, but now you've used `print()` in HEAPS of questions and you might find that first question easier now!

I actually think it's good if you find coding kinda difficult. Like Renee said, programmers have to learn new things all the time, and I find that really exciting and fun! I love starting a problem with no idea how to do it, because I know that (if I try hard and ask for help!) I'll finish the problem as a WAY better programmer than when I started.

My name is Lyndsey and I'm one of the tutors for the NCSS challenge and a GPN tutor in Sydney. I studied programming in high school (I was the only person in my whole year that took programming for my HSC!) And really enjoyed it. I volunteered to tutor GPN and loved teaching girls how to code, it helped me to learn python again and introduced me to some really cool people. Coding can be challenging but when you finally crack the problem it's amazing! There are lots of girl programmers out there doing so many creative things with code, so keep at it!

Thanks Reese",TRUE,FALSE,MESSAGE
11eba822b716d31772f238baa219ed6a,259502,1534480227,"Hi Reese!

It's Renee from this morning! 

Happy to answer some questions for you and there are some other tutors who are going to answer some questions for you in a bit too :D 

Just going to point out that outside of GPN you should only use the tutor messaging to ask questions about the challenge problems, but since you are at GPN it is a bit different this time. 

So to answer your question about how the tutors picked. All the the tutors are volunteers and we basically take who ever would like to volunteer who knows some coding and wants to work with the rest of the tutor team. It's a great way to learn more coding by teaching, so we are really happy to have all the volunteers we can get to help them learn. The volunteers range from university students, to teachers, to professional software developers. 

So I am a professional software developer and I don't know if I would say it is easy. I would say that you are always learning something new. As you find with the NCSS Challenge problems, once you know what you need to do you just need to type it out. It is often not that much code, the typing doesn't take very long. Most of my job as a software developer is thinking, thinking about all the different parts of a problem, thinking about where I need to write the code to add a feature, thinking about all the parts of the system that my code will interact with. Typing the code doesn't take that long once you know what you want to type and where you want to type it. But you often need to learn something new before you actually write the code. So that's what I do every day, lots of thinking and then working out what I need to learn to solve a problem. 

So yes, programming is always a tad challenging for me too! Because you always need to learn something new! But it's normally because you are solving a new and interesting problem every single day, so it is very exciting. And other software developers are normally very happy to help you learn things, so that is pretty fun too :D

Your program will need to work for _any pie idea_ that the user types in.

Therefore, you will need to use a `for` loop to go through each letter in the Pie Idea and print it on the screen.

I suggest you start by just trying to print each individual letter (one per line). Once that is working, you can make it print the `ord` number instead.

Python is then getting confused because you're trying to **slice** the `boolean` value as if it were a string that could be cut up into individual characters, but it's not a string - it's a `boolean`.

When you're using `if`, you've got two parts:
1. The **condition** (`if car == 'car':`)
2. The instruction (if the condition is **true**, `print('Shotgun!')`

You need to add some spaces before the instruction. This is called *indentation*, which is explained in [this slide](https://groklearning.com/learn/challenge-beginners-2018/w2p1/1/).

This way, the computer knows which code should only be run when a certain condition is true.

On line one, the input has to be EXACTLY the way the question states it. The question is  ""How will we get there?"" You have ""How will we get there (car/no car  "". Start with fixing this.

Next, the question wants you to check for ""car"", but you are checking for ""Car"". Yes it is fussy but remember, computers are not humans and work off electrical signals.

Your submission is sooo close! You just need to be careful with spaces inside strings. Remember, `'What is your name?'` is different to `'What is your name? '`.

When using `input()`, we like to add a space at the end of the string so it appears nicer to the user when they type (""What is your name? Robert"" instead of ""What is your name?Robert"").

So, start with that. See if you get that first part working where you get the program to ask the question Simon says.

When using `input()`, we like to add a space at the end of the string so it appears nicer to the user when they type (""What is your name? Lachlan"" instead of ""What is your name?Lachlan"").

You are actually going in the right direction for this question! This question is slightly tricky as you need to use two variables (`first` and `second`) when printing out the output.

This problem requires you to get two ingredients as inputs. So, start with changing the wording of your first two lines of code. Sensible variable names help a lot with understanding code, so change your first two lines of code to ask the right questions (What is the first ingredient? and What is the second ingredient?), and use variable names like first and second. 

Once you do that, you have to join the variables together in the print statement. Try this out and let me know.

You have the right idea, that's great! Your problem is your variable names. Computers read individual words looking for methods or commands, as soon as it hits a space it thinks it has an instruction to follow. So in your first variable it thinks 'first' is a command it needs to follow, like ```print```. 

You can fix this by leaving out spaces or changing the spaces into underscores (for example 'first_ingredient') or by using one word variable names.

If you look carefully, you'll see that your `print()` statement is actually missing the closing bracket `)`.

This is because you have a small mistake in your output string. Remember that when you want to join strings together using the `+` symbol, you need to close finish each string. Currently, `'The soup of the day is Name1 + '' + Name2)` is all one long string.

Have another look at how it's done on the previous page [here](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/41201271/challenge-beginners-2018/w1p2/0/).

This question is asking you to use a `for` loop to print each letter of *any* word in uppercase.

You're actually really close. Your `for` loop does that. But after that the lines:
```
print(name[C])
```
etc. are going to throw an error. When we access a string, we use an integer, which corresponds to the index. So `print(name[0])` would get the first character.

But in this question, you don't need that. So you can delete all of those lines.

You're missing brackets after `.upper()` both times you use it.

`upper` is a _method_, which means you needs brackets after it to _call_ it (make it run). So for `upper` you need brackets to make it actually change the word to upper case. If you don't have them, you get what you are currently getting :)

df646685ac21dacc1d3367084d84defc,257371,1534328276,"Hi Tori,

Good work so far. Looking through your line 3, the syntax looks pretty good but the ""for word in word"" part is confusing. What you really want it to do is separate the two.

The for .. in command allows you to loop through something and process it one at a time. This might be the letters in a word, or student marks in a test or so on. 
Instead of saying "" for word in word"", what you really want to do is keep the variable names separate. ""word"" is what you want in the second part of that command, but the first part can be something that makes more sense - in this case, you can call the variable ""letter""

So -

for letter in word:
  print(letter.upper())

This goes through the word, one letter at a time. Inside the loop, it takes the individual letter it is up to, converts it to upper case and then prints it out.

See if you can work through that. Once you get the letters printing out, you need to print out the full word again in capitals at the end.

63235b247054debaa6b1e1e2f4d73a60,241622,1532944398,"Hi Bianca,

Your submission is sooo close! Just like Simon Says, variables (in `black`) are different from strings (in `'green'`). For example, the following code would print ""name"" every time:
```
print('name')
```
But this code would print a different value each time, depending on what was stored inside `name`:
```
print(name)
```

We can add strings and variables together, just being careful to only use quotes for strings and not for variables.

```
'My name is ' + 'name' # Prints ""My name is name""
My name is + 'name' # Gives a syntax error
'My name is' + name # Prints ""My name is Bianca""
                    # (or whatever the value stored in name is)
```

Does that make sense? I hope this helps! :)

Keep up the good work! :)

Can be read as: input from the user the answer to the question ""Favourite animal"". Print the words ""I Like "" the animal the user types "" too!""

The answer to this problem is very similar to my example above, except with a name instead of an animal.

Your solution is coming along great, but just as a hint... Think about what the following code would do:

```
print('Divyani')
```
That code would print the name 'Divyani' every time.

Now, what about the following code:

```
name = 'Divyani'
print(name)
```

It does the exact same thing, except now we have a variable called 'name' that we store the value 'Divyani' in and print the value of that.

Now what would happen if we changed the first line to:
```
name = input('What is your name?')
```
Now this is different - when we run the program, each time it runs, it will print something different, depending on what the user typed in.

Hope this helps! :) Keep up the great work! :D

You're really close!

Let's look at this line:
```py3
if name == name.islower():
```

`islower()` returns (turns into) `True` or `False`, so you're comparing `name == True` or `name == False` - as per [these notes](https://groklearning.com/learn/challenge-beginners-2018/w3p1/8/), you don't need to check if `islower()` is equal to anything - the `True` or `False` that it returns is alone good enough for the `if` statement.

Also, the `islower()` method checks if *all* the letters are lowercase, are you sure that's what you want to check?

Hope this helps! :)",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

Great work on this! I think you might have missed this part of the question: _If the name is not all uppercase, then we assume that it's correct_.

Recursion is when a function in python calls _itself_. It is sometimes used for different problems, but it needs to know when to stop calling itself. In this case, `food_combo` runs `food_combo`, which runs `food_combo`, which runs `food_combo`, etc. until it does it too many times and python crashes.

Try removing the call to `food_combo` from inside the function. You will still need to write code to calculate the combo and `return` it from the function. :)",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

The code at the bottom (under `if __name__`) is used for testing. It will call the `food_combo()` function with some test cases to confirm that the function is working correctly. You do not need to modify this testing code ?€? you should only write code at the top where it says `# Write the code to create the new food name here`.

Awesome work so far! :D You're really close to solving this question.

Yes, your observation for using the comma is correct. It's similar to the plus sign but will always add a space after which isn't quite what we want.

When you use the plus sign like this
```
print ('You have harvested' + int(kgs) + 1337 + 'kg of lemons in total.')
```

You'll get a `TypeError` and it says `must be str, not int`. It's a bit hard to understand but what it's saying is that we have an `int` in the string we want to print out. Python doesn't like this because it can only print out something if everything inside is a string.

Perhaps there's a way that we can convert the `int` to a string. Maybe looking at the [previous page](https://groklearning.com/learn/challenge-beginners-2018/w2p2/6/) of notes will help. :)",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

Well done on this question so far, you're really close to solving it! However, sending multiple messages to the tutors won't make as reply any faster, we'll always get back to you as quick as we can.

The problem is with this line here 

```
print(str('You have harvested ' + answer + 'kg of lemons in total.'))
```

See how you've wrapped the whole message inside the `str()` function. Well that's not much help to python as the whole thing is already a string. 

Instead, what we need to do, is just wrap the `answer` (which is currently an `int`), with the `str()` function, so that we convert it to a string and can join it to the rest of our message.

This is a really tricky one because Python tells you the error is on the wrong line.

A SyntaxError means that Python didn't understand your program. Syntax is a bit like grammar in English. When I say ""let's go to the "" your brain knows (and expects) that I'm going to say the name of a place (e.g. ""the shops"").

Similarly, in Python, when you open a bracket (like `int(` or `input(`), it knows that there's going to be a closing one some time later. At some point, Python is like ""wait, what's this `if` thing"", which is why the error is on the next line.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

You're doing well, but there are a few small issues with your code.

1. Your first line is trying to convert `'How many kilograms did you pick?'` into a number, is that what you wanted it to do? :)

After you've done that, you'll need to add the new total number of lemons into the `print` statement by converting the new number back to a `str`.

Have another look at [this page of the notes](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/40435693/challenge-beginners-2018/w2p1/11/) for a similar example.

```py3
print(str( ""You have harvested 1637kg of lemons in total.""))

Well, that means that no matter what the user enters for their input, your program will always print out the same thing.

That's not what we want. Your program needs to use the input the user gives, calculate the number of kilograms, and print out the correct number for their input.

You've fixed the second line in your program, so now you're correctly calculating the total number of kilograms, great work!

Now, you need to use the value of the `total` variable in your print statement.

I tried 

answer = number + 1337

For this question, you'll need to use both `int` and `str`. 

When you read in the `input`, you should make sure you're using an `int`. This is because you want to treat it like a number, and add `1337` to it.

It's only when you want to print out the new number again, should you convert it back to a `str`.

Have another look at [this page of the notes](https://groklearning.com/view-submissions/41201500/challenge-beginners-2018/w2p2/6/) if you're still confused.

At the moment what I see is that you have a mixture of commas and plus signs trying to put together your print statement.  To avoid that confusion with extra spaces, you probably want to get rid of all the commas, and replace it with a plus sign.

To make your print statement work, you will need to have a plus sign between all the different parts.  For instance, after ""str(1337)"" you have another ""("" that you don't need but you also don't have a plus sign.

You're absolutely correct! The marker does keep changing what it expects. That's because this is a key part of programming. Your answer needs to read in some input from the user, and then use that answer to change what it outputs. 

As such, no matter what number the user enters, your code should print out the same number of yips. 

Currently, your code will always print out 3 yips. But that means your code will only ever work if the user enters the number 3.

This same idea applies to every question, the marker will always try and test your code against different input values, and will expect different output as a result.

It looks like you've skipped over a bunch of questions before this one.  They're meant to be solved in order, so you might find it easier to go back to some of the previous ones and attempt to solve them first.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

This is a really tricky one because Python tells you the error is on the wrong line.

A SyntaxError means that Python didn't understand your program. Syntax is a bit like grammar in English. When I say ""let's go to the "" your brain knows (and expects) that I'm going to say the name of a place (e.g. ""the shops"").

Similarly, in Python, when you open a bracket (like `int(` or `input(`), it knows that there's going to be a closing one some time later. At some point, Python is like ""wait, what's this `if` thing"", which is why the error is on the next line.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

Crazy! It doesn't do what we want at all ?€? the answer should be 11.

The reason is that numbers and strings are different types of data, and are treated differently in Python.

The problem here is that input always returns a string even if the user enters digits. Let's see that again without the input calls:

  

print('5' + '6')

The program needs to work with any number if yips. Notice this in your code:

```
if yips == '3':
            print('yip '* 3 + song)
elif yips == '8':
            print('yip '* 8 + song)
```

Notice that when the input was '3', you multiple 'yip ' by 3, when the input is '8', you multiple by 8, etc. Since the number from input is always the same as the number you multiple the `'yip '` by, perhaps you could directly multiple by the variable from `input`?",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

Great job so far! Instead of doing this:

if yips == '3':

You can multiple the yips directly by the variable, once you convert it to an integer. See the Hint in the Problem description.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE

You have some extra spaces in both your input text and the output.

Look very carefully at the markers display of what you have and what it wants.

I suggest that you use ```'yip '``` and no space at the start of ```'ah hah!'```

and watch for a letter that should be in capitals.

The program is generally correct, but there are a couple of issues to fix.

This line:

```
yup = input (int('How many yips?')
```

is a little bit wrong. It needs to be the other way:

```
yup = int(input('How many yips?'))
```

because it first asks a question (`input`), then takes the result of that and converts it to a number (`int`). Oh, and make sure that every bracket that is opened is also closed again, or Python gets confused.

Also: When you put things in `'quotes'`, they are treated as text. So in this line:

```
print ('yup' * 'yip' + 'ah hah!')
```

`'yup'` will be treated as a string, not a variable. I suggest you remove the quotes around `yup`.",FALSE,FALSE,MESSAGE
